# HTTP

#### Solana nodes accept HTTP requests using the JSON-RPC 2.0 specication.

## • For JavaScript applications, use the @solana/web3.js library as a convenient^

#### interface for the RPC methods to interact with a Solana node.

## • For a PubSub connection to a Solana node, use the WebSocket API.

#### To make a JSON-RPC request, send an HTTP POST request with a Content-Type:

#### application/json header. The JSON request data should contain the following elds:

```
Field Type Description
```
```
jsonrpc string Set to "2.0".
```
```
id string | number
```
```
A unique identi er for the
request, generated by the
client. Can be a string, number,
or null.
```
```
method string
```
```
The name of the method to
invoke.
```
```
params array
```
```
A JSON array of ordered
parameter values.
```

## Example Request using cURL


#### The response will be a JSON object with the following elds:

#### Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects in a

#### single POST request.

#### The commitment parameter should be included as the last element in the params array:

```
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -s -X POST -H "Con
{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"id": 1,
"method": "getBalance",
"params": [

### Response Format

## Batch Requests

### Example Request with Commitment


- **Hash** : A SHA-256 hash of a chunk of data.
- **Pubkey** : The public key of an Ed25519 key-pair.
- **Transaction** : A list of Solana instructions signed by a client keypair to authorize those^

#### actions.

- **Signature** : An Ed25519 signature of a transaction's payload data, including^

#### instructions. This can be used to identify transactions.

#### Although not part of the JSON-RPC API, a GET /health request at the RPC HTTP

#### endpoint provides a health-check mechanism for load balancers or other network

#### infrastructure.

```
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -s -X POST -H "Con
{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"id": 1,
"method": "getBalance",
